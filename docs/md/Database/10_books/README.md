## Readings in Database Systems

* [Readings in Database Systems](http://www.redbook.io/)

Readings in Database Systems (commonly known as the "Red Book") has offered readers an opinionated take on both classic
and cutting-edge research in the field of data management since 1988.

Today’s data platforms range greatly in complexity. From simple caching layers or polyglotic persistence right through to wholly integrated data pipelines. There are many paths. They go to many different places. In some of these places at least, nice things are found.

So the aim for this talk is to explain how and why some of these popular approaches work. We’ll do this by first considering the building blocks from which they are composed. These are the intuitions we’ll need to pull together the bigger stuff later on.

## Apache Kafka, Samza, and the Unix Philosophy of Distributed Data

One of the things I realised while doing research for my book is that contemporary software engineering still has a lot to learn from the 1970s. 
As we’re in such a fast-moving field, we often have a tendency of dismissing older ideas as irrelevant – and consequently, we end up having to learn the same lessons over and over again, the hard way. Although computers have got faster, data has got bigger and requirements have become more complex, many old ideas are actually still highly relevant today. 
In this blog post I’d like to highlight one particular set of old ideas that I think deserves more attention today: the Unix philosophy. 
I’ll show how this philosophy is very different from the design approach of mainstream databases, 
and explore what it would look like if modern distributed data systems learnt a thing or two from Unix.
